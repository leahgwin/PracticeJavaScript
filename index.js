   GIVEN: a string, this is usually a bunch of words but doesn't need to be.

      An object (hashmap) that contains the 10 longest words and their counts.
      All output words must be lower cased. If there's a tie in length then
        alphabetical order matters and fall back to that.

      If the input string doesn't have at least 10 words then return null.
